# Visualizing-Earths-Climate-Change
Visualizing worldwide climate change with <code>cartopy</code> and <code>xarray</code>. The data used for this task are originated from NASA's GISTEMP v4 dataset used in a gridded monthly structure as a netCDF file. The gridded surface contains air temperature anomaly data series on a regular 2°×2° grid from 1880 to present.
