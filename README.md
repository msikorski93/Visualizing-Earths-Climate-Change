# Visualizing-Earths-Climate-Change
Visualizing worldwide climate change with <code>cartopy</code> and <code>xarray</code>. The data used for this task are originated from NASA's GISTEMP v4 dataset used in a gridded monthly structure as a netCDF file. The gridded surface contains air temperature anomaly data series on a regular 2°×2° grid from 1880 to present.

The results of this notebook are: static maps and a simple animation as GIF file attached to this repository. With these visualizations, we presented that Earth's climate is constantly increasing and global warming is undeniable.

### New notebook for August 2023
A new climate change visualization was developed in <code>cartopy</code> and <code>xarray</code>. The geospatial and meteorological data were originated from Copernicus as GRIB files. The results of the new notebook are two basemaps with 30 year span.

Again, these plots demonstrate temperature increase and global warming on Earth. Additionaly, the notebook contains a plot of temperature anomaly over Antarctica in June 2023.
